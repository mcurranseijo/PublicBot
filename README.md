# Discord.py Public Project Bot

The goal of this bot is to create a bot full of functions made by different users, it should be at least somewhat documented so it can be used to learn from just as much as played with.

### Installing

* Download the main.py file and cogs folder, these should all be placed together
* Go to the URL in the LastFM.py file and generate an API key for the search functions (if you don't need these commands this step is unnecesary)
* Place your bot API key in the marked location at the bottom of Main.py
* Your bot should be good to go
